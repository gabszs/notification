The `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file commonly used in Python projects to specify project metadata, dependencies, build instructions, and various tool configurations. In this particular file, the `pyproject.toml` is structured for use with the Poetry package manager, which simplifies dependency management and packaging. Below is a detailed explanation of the contents of this file:

### `[tool.poetry]`
This section contains metadata about the project.

- **`name = "notification"`**: This specifies the name of the project. In this case, the project is named `notification`.
  
- **`version = "0.1.10"`**: This indicates the current version of the project. Semantic versioning is typically used.
  
- **`description = ""`**: A brief description of the project. It's currently empty.
  
- **`authors = ["GabrielCarvalho <gabrielcarvalho.workk@gmail.com>"]`**: Lists the authors of the project along with their contact information.

- **`readme = "README.md"`**: Specifies the file that contains the project's README, which is typically used to describe the project, how to install, use, and contribute to it.

### `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`
This section specifies the project’s runtime dependencies.

- **`python = ">=3.11,<=3.13"`**: Indicates the compatible versions of Python for this project, from version 3.11 to 3.13.

- **`pydantic-settings = "^2.3.4"`**: Specifies that the project depends on the `pydantic-settings` package, version 2.3.4 or any compatible newer minor version.

- **`pika = "^1.3.2"`**: The `pika` library is used for connecting to RabbitMQ message broker.

- **`aio-pika = "^9.4.3"`**: An asynchronous library for interacting with RabbitMQ.

- **`aiosmtplib = "^3.0.2"`**: An asynchronous SMTP client for sending emails.

- **`icecream = "^2.1.3"`**: A Python library for debugging, provides a nicer way to print debug information.

### `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`
This section lists the development dependencies, which are not required for the project in production.

- **`pytest-cov = "^4.1.0"`**: A Pytest plugin for measuring code coverage.

- **`taskipy = "^1.12.2"`**: A simple task runner for your Python projects.

- **`ruff = "^0.1.8"`**: A fast Python linter.

- **`pytest-asyncio = "^0.23.2"`**: Pytest support for asyncio.

- **`freezegun = "^1.4.0"`**: Allows your Python tests to travel through time by mocking the date and time.

- **`faker = "^24.1.0"`**: A library to generate fake data.

- **`ipykernel = "^6.29.3"`**: Provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter.

- **`pytest = "^8.1.1"`**: A testing framework for Python.

### `[build-system]`
This section defines the build system requirements.

- **`requires = ["poetry-core"]`**: Specifies that `poetry-core` is required to build the project.

- **`build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"`**: Specifies the backend used for building the package.

### `[tool.taskipy.tasks]`
Defines custom tasks that can be run using Taskipy, a simple task runner.

- **`lint = 'ruff .'`**: Runs the `ruff` linter on the codebase.

- **`pre_test = 'task lint'`**: Runs the `lint` task before testing.

- **`test = 'pytest -s -x --capture=no --cov=notification -vv'`**: Runs the test suite with Pytest, showing detailed output, stopping at the first failure, and capturing no output. It also measures code coverage for the `notification` module.

- **`verbose_test = 'pytest --verbose --show-capture=all --exitfirst --cov=notification --cov-report=term-missing -vv'`**: Similar to `test`, but with more verbose output and showing missing coverage directly in the terminal.

- **`commit_hook = "pre-commit run --all-files"`**: Runs pre-commit hooks on all files.

- **`post_verbose_test = 'coverage html'`**: Generates an HTML report of the test coverage.

- **`post_test = 'coverage html'`**: Also generates an HTML report of the test coverage after tests run.

### `[tool.ruff]`
Configures the Ruff linter.

- **`exclude = [...]`**: A list of directories to exclude from linting, commonly ignored directories for version control, build artifacts, and virtual environments.

- **`line-length = 120`**: Sets the maximum line length to 120 characters, similar to Black's default.

- **`indent-width = 4`**: Sets the indentation width to 4 spaces.

- **`target-version = "py38"`**: Assumes the target Python version for linting is Python 3.8.

### `[tool.ruff.lint]`
Settings for linting behavior in Ruff.

- **`select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F"]`**: Specifies the linting rules to enable.

- **`ignore = ["E701"]`**: Specifies linting rules to ignore.

- **`fixable = ["ALL"]`**: Allows fixing all enabled rules when `--fix` is used.

- **`unfixable = []`**: No rules are specified as unfixable.

- **`dummy-variable-rgx = "^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$"`**: Regular expression pattern to allow unused variables that are prefixed with an underscore.

### `[tool.ruff.format]`
Configures code formatting options in Ruff.

- **`quote-style = "double"`**: Enforces the use of double quotes for strings.

- **`indent-style = "space"`**: Enforces the use of spaces, not tabs, for indentation.

- **`skip-magic-trailing-comma = false`**: Does not skip the magic trailing comma.

- **`line-ending = "auto"`**: Automatically detects the appropriate line ending.

This configuration file is tailored for a project developed with modern Python practices, utilizing Poetry for dependency management and Ruff for linting, alongside various tools for testing and task automation.
