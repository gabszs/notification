Certainly! Below is a detailed documentation for the provided Python script, which appears to be a part of a microservices-based notification system built with FastAPI:

# File Documentation: `main.py`

## Overview
This script is designed to handle notifications by consuming messages from a RabbitMQ queue. It uses a `Notification` service to process these messages and acknowledges them accordingly. The script integrates with RabbitMQ using a connection established in the `rabbit_connection` module and relies on settings defined in the `settings` module. It also uses the `icecream` library for debugging purposes.

## Imports
- `os` and `sys`: Standard Python libraries used for operating system interactions and system-specific parameters and functions.
- `icecream` (`ic`): A third-party library used for debugging. In this script, it provides a way to print debug information.
- `rabbit_connection`: A module assumed to be responsible for establishing and managing a connection to a RabbitMQ server.
- `settings`: A module that contains configuration settings for the application, including queue names.
- `Notification`: A service class that encapsulates the logic for handling notifications.

## Functions

### `main()`
The `main` function orchestrates the primary operations of the script, including connecting to RabbitMQ, declaring a queue, consuming messages, and handling them via the `Notification` service.

- **Initialization and Connection**:
  - A `Notification` object is instantiated and connected to its required services.
  - A channel to RabbitMQ is opened through `rabbit_connection`.

- **Queue Declaration**:
  - The script declares a queue using `channel.queue_declare`, specifying the queue name from `settings.audio_queue` and setting it as durable to ensure messages are not lost if the server restarts.

- **Message Consumption**:
  - A `callback` function is defined to process incoming messages:
    - It prints the received message.
    - It calls the `notification` instance to process the message body.
    - Depending on whether an error occurred (indicated by the return value of the `notification` call), it acknowledges (`basic_ack`) or negatively acknowledges (`basic_nack`) the message to RabbitMQ.
  - The script consumes messages from the specified queue using `channel.basic_consume`, tying the `callback` function to message processing.
  - A message is printed to the console indicating that the script is waiting for messages in the "audio" queue.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - Any exceptions raised during the execution of the `main` function lead to closing the notification and channel connections.

## Execution Block
The script includes a standard Python entry-point check (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to allow it to be run as a standalone program.

- **Exception Handling for Keyboard Interrupt**:
  - The script listens for a `KeyboardInterrupt` (e.g., triggered by pressing `CTRL+C`) to gracefully exit.
  - Upon interruption, it logs the event using `icecream` and attempts to exit the program using `sys.exit(0)`.
  - If `sys.exit(0)` fails, it forcibly terminates the program using `os._exit(0)`.

## Key Considerations
- **Error Management**: The script attempts to manage errors by closing connections and re-raising exceptions, ensuring that resources are properly released.
- **Durability**: The use of a durable queue ensures that messages are not lost in the event of a RabbitMQ server restart.
- **Debugging**: The `icecream` library is used to provide insight during the script's execution, particularly when interrupted by the user.

This script is crucial for handling message-based notifications in a microservices architecture, leveraging RabbitMQ for message queuing and processing through a dedicated `Notification` service.
