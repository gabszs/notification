Certainly! Below is a detailed documentation for the given Python file located at `C:\Users\g50034179\Documents\fastapi\microservices_mpe\notification\notification\schemas/file_schema.py`. This file defines data models using the Pydantic library, which is commonly used in FastAPI applications for data validation and serialization.

### File Overview

This file defines two main data models using Pydantic: `FileMetadata` and `QueueMessage`. These models are likely used to validate incoming data related to file handling in a microservices architecture, specifically for notifications.

### Imports

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic import constr
from pydantic import field_validator
```

- **typing.Optional**: This is used to denote that a variable can be of a specified type or `None`.
- **pydantic.BaseModel**: The base class provided by Pydantic for creating data models. It allows automatic data validation and serialization.
- **pydantic.constr**: A Pydantic type used to enforce constraints on strings, such as minimum length.
- **pydantic.field_validator**: A decorator used to create custom validation logic for specific fields in a model.

### Class: `FileMetadata`

```python
class FileMetadata(BaseModel):
    file_name: constr(min_length=1)  # type: ignore
    content_type: Optional[str]

    @field_validator("content_type")
    def check_content_type(cls, extension):
        allowed_video_types = [
            "video/mp4",
            "video/x-matroska",  # .mkv
            "video/avi",
            "video/webm",
            "video/ogg",
        ]
        if extension not in allowed_video_types:
            raise ValueError("File Type not allowed, please send a video file")
        return extension
```

- **file_name**: This field is a constrained string (`constr`) with a minimum length of 1 character. This ensures that an empty file name is not valid.

- **content_type**: This field is optional and can be of type `str` or `None`. It is intended to store the MIME type of the file.

- **@field_validator("content_type")**: This is a Pydantic validator method that checks the `content_type` field. 
  - **check_content_type(cls, extension)**: This method ensures that the `content_type` of the file is one of the allowed video types. If the content type does not match one of the predefined video MIME types (`video/mp4`, `video/x-matroska`, etc.), it raises a `ValueError`.

### Class: `QueueMessage`

```python
class QueueMessage(FileMetadata):
    client_email: str
    download_link: str
```

- **Inheritance from `FileMetadata`**: `QueueMessage` extends the `FileMetadata` class, inheriting all its fields and validation logic (e.g., `file_name` and `content_type`).

- **client_email**: A string field intended to store the email address of the client. This should typically be a valid email address, though additional validation for email format is not shown here.

- **download_link**: A string field that stores a URL or path where the file can be downloaded. This is likely used to provide clients with access to the uploaded file.

### Key Logic

- **Validation**: The main logic in this file revolves around validating the `content_type` of files to ensure they are allowed video types. This is crucial for applications dealing with file uploads to ensure that only supported formats are processed.

- **Data Modeling**: By using Pydantic's `BaseModel`, the application can easily handle JSON data, ensuring that data exchanged in API requests is correctly structured and valid.

### Usage

In a FastAPI application, these models could be used in API endpoints to automatically validate request data. For example, when receiving a file upload, the `FileMetadata` model ensures the file name and content type are valid before proceeding with further processing. Similarly, `QueueMessage` could be used to structure messages sent to a message queue, ensuring that all necessary information is present and correctly formatted.

This structured approach to data validation helps maintain the integrity of data within the application, reduces error handling code, and improves the overall robustness of the system.
