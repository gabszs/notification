Below is a detailed documentation for the provided Python module located at `C:\Users\g50034179\Documents\fastapi\microservices_mpe\notification\notification\core/dependencies.py`. This module is responsible for setting up RabbitMQ connection dependencies for a FastAPI-based microservice.

```python
import pika

from notification.core.settings import settings

rabbit_credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(settings.RABBITMQ_USER, settings.RABBITMQ_PASS)
rabbit_connection = pika.BlockingConnection(
    pika.ConnectionParameters(host=settings.RABBIT_URL, credentials=rabbit_credentials)
)

__all__ = ["rabbit_credentials", "rabbit_connection"]
```

### Module Overview

This module is responsible for setting up and exporting RabbitMQ connection dependencies using the `pika` library. These dependencies can then be used throughout the application to facilitate communication with a RabbitMQ message broker.

### Imports

- `pika`: This is a Python client library for RabbitMQ, which is a message-broker software that facilitates communication between different services.
- `notification.core.settings`: This import is used to access the `settings` object, which presumably contains configuration settings for the application, including credentials and the URL for the RabbitMQ server.

### Key Components

#### `rabbit_credentials`

- **Type**: `pika.PlainCredentials`
- **Description**: This object holds the credentials necessary for authenticating with the RabbitMQ server.
- **Initialization**: 
  - `settings.RABBITMQ_USER`: The username for the RabbitMQ server, retrieved from the application's settings.
  - `settings.RABBITMQ_PASS`: The password for the RabbitMQ server, also fetched from the application's settings.
- **Purpose**: To securely store and provide authentication information when establishing a connection to the RabbitMQ server.

#### `rabbit_connection`

- **Type**: `pika.BlockingConnection`
- **Description**: This represents a blocking connection to the RabbitMQ server.
- **Initialization**:
  - `pika.ConnectionParameters`: This class is used to define the connection parameters.
  - `host=settings.RABBIT_URL`: The URL of the RabbitMQ server, obtained from the settings.
  - `credentials=rabbit_credentials`: The credentials required to authenticate with the server, as defined by the `rabbit_credentials` object.
- **Purpose**: To establish and maintain a connection with the RabbitMQ server, enabling the application to send and receive messages.

### `__all__`

- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: This list defines the public API of the module by specifying which attributes are exportable when the module is imported using `from module_name import *`.
- **Contents**: 
  - `"rabbit_credentials"`: Makes the `rabbit_credentials` object available for import.
  - `"rabbit_connection"`: Makes the `rabbit_connection` object available for import.

### Summary

This module provides the necessary setup for connecting to a RabbitMQ server using credentials and connection parameters defined in the application's settings. The `pika` library is utilized to handle the connection, and the module exports the connection and credentials objects for use in other parts of the application, facilitating message-based communication between different services in the microservice architecture.
