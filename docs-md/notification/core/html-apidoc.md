# File Documentation: `html.py`

This file contains an HTML template designed for rendering a notification page to inform users about the successful conversion of a video file to MP3 format. It is structured as a Python string, allowing for easy integration into a web application, particularly within a FastAPI microservice setup.

## File Path
`C:\Users\g50034179\Documents\fastapi\microservices_mpe\notification\notification\core\html.py`

## Overview
The primary content of this file is a string variable named `html_template`, which holds an HTML document structure. This template is likely used for generating a response to users upon the successful completion of a video-to-MP3 conversion process. The HTML is styled with basic CSS to enhance the visual presentation.

## Contents

### `html_template`

- **Type**: String
- **Purpose**: Stores an HTML document that acts as a template for creating a notification webpage. This webpage informs users that their video conversion to MP3 was successful and provides a download link for the MP3 file.

#### Structure and Key Elements

1. **HTML Head Section**:
   - **Meta Charset**: Specifies UTF-8 character encoding for the document, ensuring that it supports a wide range of characters.
   - **Title**: Sets the page title to "Conversion Successful".
   - **Style**: Contains embedded CSS that styles the body, container, headings, paragraphs, download links, and footer.

2. **Body Section**:
   - **Container Div**: Acts as a wrapper for the main content, providing a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow for improved aesthetics.
   - **Heading (`<h1>`)**: Displays the title "Conversion Successful!" to clearly communicate the outcome to the user.
   - **Paragraphs (`<p>`)**: 
     - The first paragraph informs the user that their video has been successfully converted to an MP3.
     - The second paragraph instructs the user to click the link below to download the MP3 file.
   - **Download Link (`<a>`)**: 
     - This is a placeholder link element (`<a href="{download_link}" class="download-link">Download MP3</a>`), where `{download_link}` is a placeholder to be replaced by the actual URL for downloading the MP3 file.
     - Styled as a button with a blue background and white text to make it visually distinct and actionable.
   - **Footer Paragraph**: 
     - Provides a thank-you message to the user for utilizing the service, styled in a smaller font to differentiate it from the main content.

### `__all__`

- **Definition**: `__all__ = ["html_template"]`
- **Purpose**: Lists the names of the module's public objects. By including `html_template` in `__all__`, it explicitly defines what should be accessible when the module is imported using the `from <module> import *` syntax.

### Commented Code

- A commented-out line at the end of the file seems to provide an example or alternative format for the download link:
  ```python
  # <a href="{donwload_svc}/?file_name={mp3_filename}" class="download-link">Download MP3</a>
  ```
  - **Purpose**: It serves as a placeholder or suggestion for constructing a URL using parameters such as `donwload_svc` (likely a base URL for the download service) and `mp3_filename` (the specific file name for the MP3).

## Usage

This template can be utilized in a FastAPI endpoint or any web application to dynamically generate an HTML page by injecting the appropriate URL into the `{download_link}` placeholder. This is typically done using string formatting techniques in Python to provide the actual download URL to the user.
