# `notification_service.py` Documentation

## Overview

The `notification_service.py` file is responsible for handling email notifications using SMTP. It provides a mechanism to send emails with download links to clients. The main class, `Notification`, manages the SMTP connection, constructs email messages, and sends them.

## Imports

- `smtplib`: A built-in Python module used for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
- `MIMEMultipart` and `MIMEText` from `email.mime`: Classes used to create email messages with multiple parts and text content.
- `Optional` from `typing`: A utility for type hinting that indicates a variable may be of a specified type or `None`.
- `icecream`: A library for debugging that provides an `ic` function to print variables with context.
- `EmailStr` from `pydantic`: A type that ensures a string is a valid email address.
- `html_template` from `notification.core.html`: A predefined HTML template used for email body construction.
- `settings` from `notification.core.settings`: Presumably contains configuration settings like SMTP server details.
- `QueueMessage` from `notification.schemas.file_schema`: A schema model that validates and parses JSON messages from a queue.

## Class: `Notification`

The `Notification` class encapsulates the logic for sending email notifications. It handles connecting to an SMTP server, constructing email messages, and sending them.

### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    smtp_server: str = settings.smtp_server,
    port: int = settings.email_port,
    sender_email: str = settings.sender_email,
    username: str = settings.login,
    password: str = settings.email_password,
) -> None:
```

- **Purpose**: Initializes a `Notification` instance with default settings for the SMTP server, port, sender email, username, and password, which are retrieved from a settings module.
- **Parameters**:
  - `smtp_server`: The SMTP server address.
  - `port`: The port number for the SMTP server.
  - `sender_email`: The email address from which the notifications will be sent.
  - `username`: The username for SMTP authentication.
  - `password`: The password for SMTP authentication.
- **Attributes**:
  - `self.connection`: Initially set to `None`, it will hold the SMTP connection.

### `connect`

```python
def connect(self) -> None:
```

- **Purpose**: Establishes a connection to the SMTP server using the provided credentials and starts TLS for secure communication.
- **Behavior**: Connects to the SMTP server and logs in using credentials if there is no existing connection.

### `is_connection_open`

```python
def is_connection_open(self) -> bool:
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if the SMTP connection is active.
- **Returns**: `True` if the connection is open, `False` otherwise.
- **Behavior**: Sends a 'no-operation' command to the server to verify the connection status.

### `get_message`

```python
def get_message(self, client_email: EmailStr, donwload_link: str) -> MIMEMultipart:
```

- **Purpose**: Constructs an email message with HTML content.
- **Parameters**:
  - `client_email`: The recipient's email address.
  - `donwload_link`: The link for downloading the MP3 file.
- **Returns**: A `MIMEMultipart` object representing the email message.
- **Behavior**: Sets the email's 'From', 'To', and 'Subject' headers and attaches an HTML body using the `generate_html` method.

### `generate_html`

```python
def generate_html(self, download_link: str) -> str:
```

- **Purpose**: Generates the HTML content for the email.
- **Parameters**:
  - `download_link`: The URL to be embedded in the HTML content.
- **Returns**: A string of HTML formatted with the download link.

### `__call__`

```python
def __call__(self, queue_message: bytes) -> bool:
```

- **Purpose**: Processes a message from the queue and sends an email notification.
- **Parameters**:
  - `queue_message`: A byte string representing the message from the queue, which includes the client's email and download link.
- **Returns**: `False` if the email was sent successfully, `True` if there was an error.
- **Behavior**:
  - Validates and parses the queue message using `QueueMessage`.
  - Constructs the email using `get_message`.
  - Ensures the SMTP connection is active, reconnecting if necessary.
  - Sends the email and logs success or error using `icecream`.

### `close`

```python
def close(self):
```

- **Purpose**: Closes the SMTP connection if it is open.
- **Behavior**: Quits the SMTP connection and sets `self.connection` to `None`.

## Key Logic

- The `Notification` class is designed to be reused, maintaining a connection to the SMTP server while sending multiple emails.
- The `__call__` method allows an instance of `Notification` to act like a function, processing queue messages directly.
- Error handling is incorporated to ensure that connection issues or message parsing errors are logged and do not crash the application.

Overall, this module provides a simple and effective way to send email notifications using SMTP, leveraging the FastAPI and Pydantic libraries for integration and data validation.
